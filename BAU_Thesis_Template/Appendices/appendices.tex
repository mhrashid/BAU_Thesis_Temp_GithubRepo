AMF0 and AMF1 denote AMF inoculated and AMF non-inoculated]{Effects of interaction of AMF inoculation and Zn management on grain yield of hybrid maize Kohinoor 1820. AMF0 and AMF1 denote AMF inoculated and AMF non-inoculated, repsectively. NoZinc = no Zn fertilizer (control); Basal100 = 100\% recommended dose (RD) of Zn added during final land preparation; Foliar100@EV = 100\% RD of Zn was applied as foliar spray (0.1\% ZnSO4) during early vegetative (EV) stage; Folar100@Rp = 100\% RD of Zn fertilizer was applied as foliar spray during early reporductive (Rp) stage; Foliar@50EV+50Rp = 100\% RD of Zn was applied as foliar spray by equal split during EV and Rp stages. Vertical bar represents mean Â± standard deviation; values of bars with different letters are significantly different at P=0.05} % caption can be placed on top of figure by putting it before \includegraphics command.
